                                repitions, a learning technique that will display the flashcard on 1 day, 3 days,
                                1 week and then 30 days intervals in that order.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The flashcards are made through
                                a txt file that is intended to have sources such as stories inputed into it. The
                                words are then organised by frequency and cards are made from them. The translations
                                are webscraped from bab.la.</span>
