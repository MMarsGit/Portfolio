            <h2 class="Title">About</h2>

            <div class="section">
                <p class="AboutDesc">I have been involved in tech from a very young age. As soon as I could think for my self
                    I was infront of a screen and I became very enthusiastic about it. It really all started
                    with the advent of the internet and since then I have tried my best to understand computers
                    themselves at a deeper and deeper level.
                </p>
        
                <p class="AboutDesc">Orignally I was preparing myself to go into the games industry. I had this urge to create something
                    and it felt like this was the natural step for me to go. It turns out I wasn't as interested in that 
                    area as I thought I was but through the route it had taken me I had learned that I really did enjoy
                    programming itself.
                </p>
        
                <p class="AboutDesc">To me programming is a way to problem solve and rack my brain on something I know I can do if I put enough
                    thought into it. I always want to challenge myself further if I can and go deeper into it as if it exists
                    I need to know how it works.
                </p>
        
                <p class="AboutDesc">I enjoy python programming a lot because it allows me to do this without getting slowed down by the small
                    errors that pop up in other languages because of syntax. However, that is not to say I would use it over
                    any other. In python I can't explore aspects such as multithreading properly as too much of it is handled
                    for you. In that sense Java is a unique challenge for me due to its unapologetic way of throwing you deep
                    into a lot of these concepts. I have a lot of fun working with Java's strict use of object oriented
                    programming and working within those restrictions as I feel it leads me to particularly efficient methods
                    of programming.
                </p>
        
                <p class="AboutDesc">My biggest challenge was working in my Operating Systems module at university. Working in a low language and 
                    having to work with memory was incredibly frustrating at times however the end results were very rewarding.
                    It taught me many lessons in managing my workflow. I hadn't really understood just how important it was to
                    plan code beforehand until then and I also learned how to effectively plan my debugging and testing to ensure
                    everything is up to standard. I believe I can take these skills forward as they are valuable in how they have
                    improved my ability as a programmer.
                </p>
        
                <p class="AboutDesc">Going forward I wish to push myself and learn new areas or improve in the ones I already have experience in so
                    I can improve further as a programmer and bring value into new programs that are being developed currently.
